We learned about function and class template and different types of polymorphism along with casting method that can be done in several ways. All these features in C++ allow for code reusability allowing code to be usable for a range of different data types. Templates act as a representation or variable for a data type. Which can be applied to a functionâ€™s argument value, or the data stored in a data structure or class. Another topic discussed is about polymorphism. Which furthermore enhances reusability to provide method and structures a very big class that can perform many things. There is compile time polymorphism and runtime. Compile time can be function overloading which involves identical names and scopes but a different parameter qualification. Or there is operator overloading which involves using an operator for a shorthand operation that is complicated to carry out. There is also runtime polymorphism which involves virtual functions, which involves methods to be called as derived from a parent class at runtime o determine a objects type.
